# Browser Technologies

# Introduction

In this course there is a lot of research about how the browser respond to design we create for the users. It's a process that everyone knows but no one implements it in the their designs. We tend to loose focus for the feature you are building but in the end we don't know which devices it is gonna be viewed on.

# Layers

## HTML-only

__Form Post__
In the first layer the focus was mainly on making the form work. This has been possible through rendering it server-sided. The data would then be added to a database, in this case to Mongo DB.

__Update__
In the first setup the data is sent but also render with a templating tool. In the second screen user can interact with their data by updating if necessary.

__Search__
Lastly, when the user, for whatever reason, cannot proceed to print there is an option to retrieve data the have sended. The form adds an extra code which gives the user an unique **id** which they layer can fill in the searchbar. This way they are able to customize, save and print their desired shirt.

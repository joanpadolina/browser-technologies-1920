# Browser Technologies

# Introduction

In this course there is a lot of research about how the browser respond to design we create for the users. It's a process that everyone knows but no one implements it in the their designs. We tend to loose focus for the feature you are building but in the end we don't know which devices it is gonna be viewed on.
